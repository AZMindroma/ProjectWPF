# ProjectWPF
This was made somewhere around 2021, with me testing out what kinds of stuff I could do with WPF. Turns out, quite a lot! It was like a dream come true since I always had a fascination with creating programs and stuff. You know, the standard Windows kid stuff.

If for some reason you wanna clone this, you need to replace all instances of "Mindroma" with your own name and of course import it to C:\Users\YourName\source\repos. I don't know if it will work on Linux, only Windows is tested so far. Well, the images will need to be changed in any case. If anyone has got a smart solution to this, you can let me know. I'm just kinda braindead. I'm just posting this here for archiving purposes.
