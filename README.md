# ProjectWPF
This was made somewhere around 2021, with me testing out what kinds of stuff I could do with WPF. Turns out, quite a lot! It was like a dream come true since I always had a fascination with creating programs and stuff. You know, the standard Windows kid stuff.

## Running
If for some reason you wanna clone this, you need to replace all instances of "Mindroma" inside all files with your own name and of course import the repo to C:\Users\YourName\source\repos (or whatever your Visual Studio folder is). If anyone has got a smart solution to this, you can let me know. I'm just kinda braindead. I'm just posting this here for archiving purposes.

(I don't think this will work for platforms other than Windows.)
