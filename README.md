# WPFApp1
This was made in 2021ish, with me testing out what kinds of stuff I could do with WPF. Turns out, quite a lot! It was like a dream come true.

If for some reason you wanna clone this, you need to replace all instances of "Mindroma" with your own name and of course import it to C:\Users\YourName\source\repos. I don't know if it will work on Linux, only Windows is tested so far.
